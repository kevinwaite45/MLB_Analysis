# MLB_Analysis
This goal of this project is to analyze how much an MLB player's performance is correlated year to year. To do this, I am using several variables from one year as the input variables, and then using a single all-encompassing variable from the next year as my response variable. More in-depth detail can be found in the attached report, and I have attached the code I used as well.
